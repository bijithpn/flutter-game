# 👋 Introduction

<p align="center"><img src="../images/shadify.png" alt="Promo"/></p>

Shadify is a powerful REST API service provides a collection of different puzzle types, like crosswords, Sudoku, word search and so on. The API allows users to generate data for puzzles, check the correctness of solutions, and configure various parameters to change the difficulty of the puzzles.

## 👍 Easy to use

You don't need to install any library, you don't need to register, no API keys and so on. To communicate with the service we use simple HTTP requests, which are described in detail in the [documentation](./documentation.md). All requested data comes in a convenient JSON format.

## 🎀 Allows to focus on UIs

Shadify can be very useful for developers who do Frontend-development. With the modules already available, you can focus entirely on creating beautiful UIs for applications that will enrich your portfolio.

## 🚀 Powered by Go

The codebase is written in the [Go programming language](https://go.dev), which is great for creating server-side applications, as well as providing high computational power.

## 💙 Open source

Shadify is a free project whose source code can be found in the [official repository](https://github.com/cheatsnake/shadify) on GitHub. You can also contribute with an [Issue](https://github.com/cheatsnake/shadify/issues) or [Pull request](https://github.com/cheatsnake/shadify/pulls).
