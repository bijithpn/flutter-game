# Anagram

<p align="center"><img src="../images/anagram.png" alt="Anagram"/></p>

[**Anagrams**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagrams_(game)) is a whole type of puzzles associated with composing all possible words from a given set of letters. This module implements the simplest variation of anagrams: a random word is given, the letters of which should be used to compose as many other words as possible. 

> Only English nouns are used for composition, a list of which can be found in this repository at the [`nouns.txt`](https://github.com/cheatsnake/shadify/blob/master/data/nouns.txt).
